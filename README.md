# Life Balance 
### - A tool for creating balance in your tasks
Life Balance is a task management tool that gives colorful visual feedback to indicate the areas users are giving the most and least attention. 

## Using the App
Users can create an account or login to an existing account securely. The users dashboard displays three active categories. Users add tasks to a category by clicking the 'add' button, edit tasks by double clicking on the text, complete a task by clicking the checkbox, and view past tasks by clicking the 'View All' link. 

## Balance
Depending on the number of tasks, the color of the category will change to indicate which area of the users life is receiving the most attention. The category with the most tasks turns red, while the others will be green or yellow, encouraging the user to tend to each area more equally. 

## User settings 
To change the active categories users can click on the hamburger menu. Only three categories can be selected at a time, so it will be necessary to deselect a previous category before selecting a new one. Tasks from inactive categories are saved and can be reactivated at any time.
